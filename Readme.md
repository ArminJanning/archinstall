FAQ:


Q: Why is this public?

A: That allows me to run curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArminJanning/archinstall/refs/heads/main/archinstall.sh > archinstall.sh


Q: Isn't curl | sh bad practice?

A: Yes. Yes it is.


Q: Why is this the only repo on your account?


A: This is a mirror of a repo which I run on my selfhosted Gitea instance. Publicizing this makes it easier to test and run on systems outside my local network.


Q: What makes this script different from all the other archinstall scripts out there?

A: Not much. I just thought it would be fun to create this one.


Q: Should I use this?

A: Probably not. This script makes a lot of assumptions (allthough it does check for stuff like firmware) and integrates some of my preferences like having multiple Kernels.
Besides that, I do not plan on supporting this project longterm and rarely test it.
